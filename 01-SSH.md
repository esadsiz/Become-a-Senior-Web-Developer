# 1. Introduction to SSH

SSH or secure shell is a protocol. What does that mean? You may have heard of other protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP. These are all ways to connect to computers and have a shared agreement of how to communicate. That is their protocol or a language that they can speak and SSH is a way for machines to communicate with one another.

For example, HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, allows you to send files over the internet like a HTML, CSS, and javascript files between browsers and servers.

FTP or file transfer protocol allows you to send files as well and is often used when you upload files something like hostgator or a generic hosting platform from your computer.

HTTPS is similar to HTTP but it is encrypted. That means third parties can't read the files being transferred if they intercept the messages. 

And there are many other protocols like IMAP that allow users to send e-mails and tons of others, and just like these, SSH is another protocol that allows us to communicate between two computers over the Internet. It allows users to share files as well as control and modify remote computers over the internet. It was created as a secure way of communication which again encrypts all data so bad actors can't monitor you. So what's the difference exactly from HTTPS? They're both a form of communication and they're both encrypted.

Just like a web browser uses the HTTPS protocol to talk with servers, and display Web sites, a shell needs a certain protocol to enable data exchange or communication between two devices and not just a browser and a server. And that's why SSH is called secure shell protocol. It's a protocol to use over shell and if you remember a shell unlike a browser allows you to talk to the operating system. 

The significant advantage offer by SSH over its predecessors is the use of encryption to ensure secure transfer of information between host and the client. The host refers to the remote server you're trying to access, while the client is the computer you're using to access the host. And any bad actor can't read our messages because of encryption. It's secure. Now let's see how to use SSH.
